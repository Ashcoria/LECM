 FRA_LOUISXIX_DESC:0 "Louis Vittorio Charles, was born on September 5th 1874, the exact same date as his ancestor Louis XIV. The only son and fifth child of King Louis XVIII and Maria Clotilde of Savoy, Louis' birth was a relief, assuring that the French line of the House of Bourbon would continue into the 20th century. During his time as the Dauphin of France, Louis was an avid scholar of French liturature and history, funding the construction of libraries and museums throughout the kingdom. He became a great admirer of the many French kings that came before, wanting in many ways to live up to their legacy. In 1907, following the death of his father, Louis was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims. Contrary to the hopes of many at the time of his coronation, Louis is not advocate of constitutionalism like his father, having appointed centrist politician Jacques Piou as Prime Minister. Wanting his name to be remembered in the same vein as his great ancestors, Louis has grand ambitions, wanting to expand French territory where ever possible, either it be in Europe or abroad."
